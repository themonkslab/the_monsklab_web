# 🤔 Before Commit

_Made with love by the_ **Monkslab** ❤️

Use [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

- [ ] Append a **! after the type/scope** if introduces a **breaking API** change => **major** in semantic versioning.
- [ ] Use **# automated reference** to epic tickets.
- [ ] Final **form**: type-of-branch(exclamation-if-braking-change)#number-of-ticket: respond-to-this-commit-will-...
- [ ] _Respond to this commit will_: should include the specifics that let you know **what that commit is about without entering inside** the code.

**Example**: feat#789: add form validations
**Example with breaking change**: feat!#789: add form validations
