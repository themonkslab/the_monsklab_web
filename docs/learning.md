_made with love by [Mau](https://github.com/maurodibert) and [Martin](https://github.com/mal2tin)  for the_ **Monkslab Team** ❤️

Generally, the best way to produce quality at fast peace is to fail fast and fix faster. So, is usual to leave tech debt for other times, best practices, or even cool awesome ideas. Something happens with the way we work.

This place could be useful to throw those things and have a document to reflect on while moving threw the dev process, at its end, and before starting new ones.

## Nice to have

## Things to improve

## Challenge

- Alias history:
  - other feature that save and persist shortened urls
  - (removes)
  - (update)
- UrlShortener+
  - the input check if is a number an change the method to retrieve constructed alias

## Things Learned

- Never observe (.watch) controller inside build method > observe always state
- Has no sense to test models using freezed; just test fromJson
