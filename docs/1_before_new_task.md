# 🧙 Before new task

## Wise, targeted and valuable solutions

- [ ] 1. `git checkout develop`
- [ ] 2. `git pull`
- [ ] 3. (optional / personal) Delete remaining unnecessary local branchs.
- [ ] 4. Follow the version control the team decided and create a new branch.
  - [ ] 1. Think of the **problem to solve** and:
    - [ ] a. Choose the **minimum solution** that adds more value aligned with business,
    - [ ] b. Take the **story card and plan** from end to beginning, research, look code. Every note or thought you make, leave it on the card: will be useful in the future.
    - [ ] c. Use comments on that story, to **ask questions and discuss**. If you hold an **offline talk**, the decisions **should be reflected** in the comments too.
    - [ ] d. If you still think the chosen solution adds more value, continue to 2; if not, repeat from 1.
  - [ ] 2. If you need code that is not on develop but on the previous branch you were working on, base the new branch on that.
  - [ ] 3. Name the new branch as follows:
    - **fix**: patches bug in your codebase => **patch** in semantic versioning.
    - **feat**: introduces a new feature to the codebase => **minor** in semantic versioning.
    - **ref**: introduces a refactor to the codebase => **minor** in semantic versioning.
    - **test**: introduces a test of a feature to the codebase => **minor** in semantic versioning.
     **Example**: **feat/17-Create-Github-Api**
  - [ ] 3. Check if flags in environment are properly set.
