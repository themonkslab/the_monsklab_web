# Monsklab Web

A online platform for us to learn, teach and connect

## :mag: Structure

With the separation of concerns in mind, I've built the application applying a clean architectural pattern. I have experience in most known state management solutions but Riverpod, so was a good opportunity to test... ... ... **Spoiler alert üôÄ**: I'm loving it!

```dart
lib
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ core // transversal features 
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ features
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ home (functional requirements)
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data
                index // every folder has an index to avoid import growth
                repository
                providers
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ domain
                index // ü§® ... ... ...
                alias // minimal naming: just what adds value
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ presentation
                controller
                index // yesp! every folder! ü§£
                view
                providers
                state
            index // just naming as index,
        index // is the monks' path for peace. üôè
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ui
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ widgets
            app_circular_progress_indicator // custom app widget -from there the 'app'-
            app_alias_card // generic app widget
        async_value_ui // a component to manage generally widget async state
        index // your really thought there wouldn't be one here? Poor inocent üòÇ
        theme
        sizes
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils
        extensions

  - History
  - Path of study
  - Pomodoro that asks you, guide you threw the learning process
  - Open positions to trainee & junior vacancies for those who finishes
  - Path: Dart course, Learn to learn, Logic
  - Challenges:
    - Quest for find in real world flutter projects, the concept and explained how is used. For instance, a static const etc.
    - Discover the bugs: a kind of treasure search where contestants find errors and proposes how to fix

## :nerd_face: Code Coverage: 100.0%

## :point_up: Decisions and Considerations

- **follow [our patterns and conventions](./docs/conventions.md)**
- **be minimal**: ask always if that piece of code ads value
- **update [changelog](./changelog.md) as priority**, letting users know where we are, with a couple of clicks
- **follow our exhaustive lifecycle for PRs with trank based strategy for version control**, to keep code cohesive, promote improvement, and precision
  - **[after_pr.md](./docs/1_after_pr.md)**
  - **[before_commit.md](./docs/2_before_commit.md)**
  - **[before_pr.md](./docs/3_before_pr.md)**
  - **[pull_request_template.md](./docs/pull_request_template.md)**

- **review code with our [standardize PR review process](./docs/review_process.md)**, helping everyone to learn, and know the code's big picture
